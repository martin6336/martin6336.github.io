> Meta-RL is meta-learning on reinforcement learning tasks. After trained over a distribution of tasks, the agent is able to solve a new task by developing a new RL algorithm with its internal activity dynamics. This post starts with the origin of meta-RL and then dives into three key components of meta-RL.

# Inferential Machine Comprehension: Answering Questions by Recursively Deducing the Evidence Chain from Text

## career
- inferential machine comprehension
## problems
- exsisting methods may be good at context matching, but have limited capability to reason across multiple sentences to deduce the right answer.
## improvement
- mimic human process for deducing the evidence chain
- reinforcement learning
## difficulty
- design a iterative process while the task is rather simple: output the option with highest score
